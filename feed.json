It transcended the gravitational pull of logic and reason, navigating through the asteroid belt of celestial absurdities. Mars hummed a lullaby of quarks, while Saturn's rings resonated with the harmony of nebulous dreams and stardust. Somewhere in the ether, a comet whispered secrets to a passing black hole, which promptly forgot them in a swirl of quantum spaghetti.<br><br>As the spacecraft drifted through the vacuum of celestial nonsense, the crew pondered the intricacies of zero-gravity cheese and the complexities of lunar lasagna. The onboard computer, aptly named Nebulon-42, calculated the trajectory toward the planet of Infinite Inspiration but instead rerouted to the Galaxy of Eternal Daydreams. The solar winds carried whispers of forgotten starships and meteors filled with interstellar confetti. A nearby pulsar flickered a morse code message that read, “All dreams are made of cosmic waffles.”</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://space-b.net/media/posts/1/nasa-UeSpvB0Qo88-unsplash-3.jpg\" alt=\"Buzz Aldrin on the surface of the moon is our inspiration for space flight\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://space-b.net/media/posts/1/responsive/nasa-UeSpvB0Qo88-unsplash-3-xs.jpg 640w ,https://space-b.net/media/posts/1/responsive/nasa-UeSpvB0Qo88-unsplash-3-sm.jpg 768w ,https://space-b.net/media/posts/1/responsive/nasa-UeSpvB0Qo88-unsplash-3-md.jpg 1024w ,https://space-b.net/media/posts/1/responsive/nasa-UeSpvB0Qo88-unsplash-3-lg.jpg 1366w ,https://space-b.net/media/posts/1/responsive/nasa-UeSpvB0Qo88-unsplash-3-xl.jpg 1600w ,https://space-b.net/media/posts/1/responsive/nasa-UeSpvB0Qo88-unsplash-3-2xl.jpg 1920w\"></figure>\n<p>Among the stars, a disco of cosmic jellybeans danced while asteroids debated whether Saturn’s rings were secretly made of bubblegum.  Landing humans on the moon is hard work.  Here are the missions that have been successful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apollo 11 (July 20, 1969)</li>\n<li>Apollo 12 (November 19, 1969)</li>\n<li>Apollo 14 (February 5, 1971)</li>\n<li>Apollo 15 (July 30, 1971)</li>\n<li>Apollo 16 (April 21, 1972)</li>\n<li>Apollo 17 (December 11, 1972)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A quotion by Edgar Mitchell from the Apollo 14 mission when he walked on the surface of the moon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Suddenly, from behind the rim of the moon, in long, slow-motion moments of immense majesty, there emerges a sparkling blue and white jewel, a light, delicate sky-blue sphere laced with slowly swirling veils of white, rising gradually like a small pearl in a thick sea of black mystery.
